# Welcome
Welcome to the [Gulf of Maine Research Institute's](www.gmri.org) Projecting Marine Species Distribution Changes in the Northwest Atlantic data visualization and access tool! We created this tool to showcase our work to understand how global climate change will influence the future spatial and temporal occurrence patterns of different marine species throughout the Northwest Atlantic shelf region. 

# FishVis Project Overview:

Species distribution shifts are one of the most widely reported biological consequences of climate-driven warming across marine ecosystems (@nyeChangingSpatialDistribution2009; @peclBiodiversityRedistributionClimate2017; @perryClimateChangeDistribution2005), creating complex challenges for contemporary management practices as species availability changes across national and international management boundaries (@hellerBiodiversityManagementFace2009; @peclBiodiversityRedistributionClimate2017; @pinskyPreparingOceanGovernance2018). 
<br>
<br>
These challenges are particularly acute in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf region, where ocean waters have experienced exceptional historical warming rates with warming projected to continue into the future (@alexanderProjectedSeaSurface2018; @pershingEvidenceAdaptation20162018; @sabaEnhancedWarmingOrthwest2016) and that boasts an international boundary separating Canada and U.S. waters -- the Hague Line. Previous efforts in this region have already documented marine species moving northward northward or to deeper waters with increasing ocean temperatures, or have identified species vulnerable to climate change, that may cause marine communities to resemble those historically found farther south (@allyna.j.ComparingSynthesizingQuantitative2020; @kleisnerMarineSpeciesDistribution2017; @nyeChangingSpatialDistribution2009; @pinskyMarineTaxaTrack2013; @stortiniAssessingMarineSpecies2015).  
<br>
<br>
In this project, we build from these efforts by (1) incorporating data from both U.S. and Canada waters, (2) developing seasonal, spatio-temporal species distribution models to account for measured habitat variables as well as unmeasured, persistent spatial and spatio-temporal patterns, and (3) projecting fitted models using future environmental conditions from the most current global climate models run as part of the 6th Climate Model Inter-comparison Project. 

# Navigating the Tool

The tool is both a data visualization and data access platform organized by species. For each species, we visualize projected changes in distribution and abundance for different seasons and across different time horizons using a collection of maps and time series plots. The data supporting each of these visualizations is then also available for download and future use by other researchers. Thank you for your interest in our work and we encourage you to pass along any feedback or ask any questions! More here...
